# testTask2

Create a pull request here with the implementation of the following task:

Create a java project, that would be packed as a jar and would be have a following public API:

public interface CalculateFactorial {
    // returns factorial of n, block with exceptions might be present or not by the choice of candidate.
    Integer factorial(Integer n) <throws Exceptions >;
}
Project should have a build script (gradle or maven). Recommended to write at least one test and some javadocs.

Task can be done partially or with any additions (it is up to candidate choice).
